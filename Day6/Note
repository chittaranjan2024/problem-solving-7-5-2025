Searching ALgorithms:

i)Sequential/Linear Search
ii)Binary Search
iii)Ternary Search

target/key element - Element that we are looking for in the array

Ternary Search:

mid1=low+(high-low)/3;
mid2=high-(high-low)/3;


Three cases:
 if target==arr[mid1]  return mid1;
 if target==arr[mid2]  return mid2;
 
 if target<arr[mid1] search the left segment
 if target>arr[mid2] search the right segment
 search mid segment
