LinkedList:
It is linear data structure that stores elements(called nodes) where each node contains:

i)Data(the element)
ii)Reference(s) to the next node(and previous in case of doubly linkedlist)


head-->first node

[12, next]--->[17,next]--->[78,next]--->[89, null]-->[17,next]




i)insert
ii)delete
iii)search
iv)size
v)display
vi)reverse

Types :

i)Singly
ii)Doubly
iii)Circular


Cycle detection/Floyd's cycle detection algorithm :(Tortoise and Hare)


Idea: Use two pointers technique
 i)Slow: Moves one step at a time
 ii)Fast: Moves two steps at a time
 
 
 If there is a cycle then the slow and fast pointer will meet.
 If there is no cycle then the fast pointer will reach the end(null).
