Count Sort: 

[2 5 3 0 2 3 0 3]   max=5

count array
 0 1 2 3 4 5
[2 0 2 3 0 1]

prefix sum

countArray[i]=countArray[i-1]+countArray[i] 

[2 2 4 7 7 8]

outputArray[countArrray[inputArray[i]]-1]=inputArray[i]

[0 0 2 2 3 3 3 5]

Dutch National Flag Problem:
0 - red
1 - White
2 - Blue

Input [2 0 2 1 1 0]
Output [0 0 1 1 2 2]


Approach:

Three pointers

low - Initially points to the start of the array, representing the boundary of 0's. 
mid - Current index being evaluated
high -Initially points to the end of the array, represents the boundary of 2's.

Quick Sort:
It is based on divide and conquer algorithm.

i)Select a pivot element from the array.(last, first or random element can be chosen as pivot)
ii)Partition the array so that:
  a)Elements smaller than the pivot come before it.
  b)Elements greater than the pivot come after it.
iii)Recursively apply the same logic to the subarrays.  

Merge Sort:

i)Divide the array into two halves.
ii)Recursively sort them.
iii)Merge the sorted halves into a single sorted array.
