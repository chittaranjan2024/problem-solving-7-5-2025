Graph:A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

Nodes: Nodes are vertices 
Edges: Connecting lines between two nodes.

G=(V,E)
V-Set of vertices
E-Set of edges


Types of Graphs:
i)Based on Direction: Directed, UnDirected

A->B

B-A

ii)Based on Weight: Unweighted, Weighted

iii)Based on Connectivity: Connected and Disconnected
iv)Cyclic and Acyclic: Cycle contains or not.

Implementation of Graph:
i)Adjacency Matrix
ii)Adjacency List
iii)Incidence Matrix


Traversing:
i)BFS
ii)DFS
